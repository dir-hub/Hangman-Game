# Hangman-Game
This repository contains a simple Hangman game implemented in the C programming language. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player must guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to "hanging," making it a race against time to guess the word correctly!
